# Introduction 

The title of this web application is Daily Goals. 
It was built with the intent to help users be more productive over the course of their day by first letting them identify the tasks they have, listing them out, and keeping track of what they have completed and whatâ€™s left to complete.


# Technologies Used  

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, google oAuth, Herkou, body-parser,
cookie-parser, debug, dotenv, ejs, express,express-session, 
http-errors, method-override, mongoose, morgan, passport, passport-google-oauth


# Getting Started 

Link to the application: 
https://immense-beyond-92274.herokuapp.com/ 


The first thing a user must do once they are on the site is to login/signup with google.  

A user won't be able to do anything on the site if they have not done one of those two. 

Once they have logged in or signed up they will have access to the home and create goals link in the nav. 

Users should first click create goal to identify a title for the goals they have set for themselves for that particular day. 

Once a user has identified a title and clicked create they will be directed back to the home page, 

where they will have access to the body of goals they have created. 

They can then either click delete, to delete the goals body and the list of goals in it or click details 

If user clicks details, they will be able to create a list of goals they have to complete, edit, and delete those goals. 

They can mark off the goals they have completed. 

They will also be able to check in to write about how they are progressing or feeling towards the goals they have set for themselves 

There may or may not be multiple users on the app, but regardless, a user can only modify the goals and the body of the goals they made. 


# Next Step 

In an attempt to enhance the users experience I plan on optimizing the app for mobile use, as well as give users a search bar to search for the 

body of goals they are looking for, as opposed to looking through each body on the home page.
